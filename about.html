       <p>Hi, I'm Jovin Aganon and I'm currently a Web Design student at Southwest CTA in Las Vegas, Nevada. I enjoy playing sports, hanging out with friends, playing video games, and spending time with family. I'm a sociable guy who loves to meet new people and I'm ready to take on any task you throw at me.</p>

       <p>Born in Oxnard, California, I grew up in a warm environment filled with fresh air and sunny beaches. Life in Oxnard for me was the only thing I knew. But after 13 years of living there, my family decided to move to Las Vegas, Nevada. Leaving my life in Oxnard was something that I never even thought of happening, but moving to Vegas meant a new opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. After 4 years of living in Vegas, I've just about completed my junior year in high school and I'm one step closer to stepping out into the real world.</p>
