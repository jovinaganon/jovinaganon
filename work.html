                      <p>Working on this project was very satisfying. After seeing the end product, I saw something that I was proud of. It showed me that I had the power to take what I was imagining in my head and place it in a computer, which was really cool. This project also reflected the skills I had in Adobe Illustrator. I was able to create a background of comets with the skills I had learned from Ms. Clark using the program.</p>

                      <p>This was an Adobe Illustrator based project where I created a poster in my own creative way. I started off a little slow because there were so many ways that I wanted to decorated my name. So I started brainstorming and thought about space. As soon as I pictured images of stars and comets in my head, I knew instantly what I wanted to do. I started creating a giant circle with smaller circles inside of it to represent collisions and tail. After giving some thought, I decided to make it the background. But decorating the name took a little time to figure out. I scrolled down the font list and guess what I found. A Halo font! As nerdy as it sounds, I can't deny that I'm a nerd for the game Halo. So I started arranging the letters of my name and had it so that it would be read diagonally.</p>

                      <p>I'd say that this project reflected my knowledge of Adobe Photoshop since I had to use what I learned when dealing with values in the program. For the mostpart it was a great deal of fun. I got to expriment with a bunch of different pictures and see how which ones worked well with others.</p>

                      <p>Creating a face out of different pictures in Adobe Photoshop was rather challenging, but fun. Being allowed a choice of theme, I decided to go with the theme of golf, which is a hobby of mine. I searched up a lot of different golf materials, from golf clubs to golf courses. I ended up using the back face of a driver to serve the base of the face. After more searching, I found myself using a tree and grass as the hair, a lake and two courses as the eyebrows and mouth, then golf balls for the eye and golf clubs as the teeth. Though just sticking them together wouldn't do it justice. I blended the items together to make a face by using the dodge and burn tools to darken the values of shadows and brighten places where light would be shining on it. After about a week, I had put together a funky looking face!</p>

                      <p>Getting to create a story for young children was a fun and awesome thing to do. There are some children out there who were less fortunate and we got to give back to them by creating something that would brighten their day. The process, however, was rather challenging. The project as a whole was something that took a great deal of teamwork and collaboration, which was a good thing. The project allowed myself to collaborate with other people in the class to create something that would be used by others. Of course there were some complications and frustrations, but that's what made it so satisfying.</p>

                      <p>Little Astro was a group project that was made in my Freshman Studies class for young children in elementary school to read. Each group had a child to create a story for and my group happened to have a kid who wanted to become a scientist. Eventually we created a story of where a boy names Little Astro ventures into an abandoned house and finds a secret laboratory. After seeing these cool gadgets and gizmos, he decides that he wants to become a scientist and invent really cool stuff and does just that. A couple days after we had created the story, we had gotten a letter from the kids we created stories for and they said they loved it!</p>

                      <p>Getting to build something that could've flew was something exciting. Although the plane crashed, building it was just as cool. I'd have to say this project really reflected my Use of Resources as well as Work Ethic since I had to find old cardboard around my house and use a ruler and a marker to know where to cut. It all took quite a bit of time, but it allowed me to reflect on my abilities to create something with the right materials.</p>

                      <p>This project was fun, but challenging. Creating something that carried an egg down 12 feet safely without the egg cracking was pretty tough. With a partner, we had to come up with something that could deliver the egg easily. Originally, we decided to use an old fashion parachute to carry the egg, until I looked in my closet and saw cardboard in the shape of a wing. So then I immediately texted my partner and proposed that we build a cardboard airplane! After a little thought about it, we were all for it. I had done most of the building myself since the materials were at my place, but it didn't matter to me. I was just really excited to see the plane in flight. After a few weeks, it was ready for takeoff. However, the moment we threw it of the catwalk, it dove forward and crash landed. I was a little disappointed, but the egg miraculously made it down!</p>

                      <p>Upon hearing about the project of creating a website about Shakespeare,  I was pretty surprised since it was my first time having my program area mixed up with one of my core classes. As soon as we were given our instructions, I researched as much as I could about Shakespeare and his life's work. Researching was just a tad bit of a hassle. Shakespeare was a rather secretive man and there aren't many official documents about him, making it difficult to find real facts and evidence of his work. However, the project was a success. In the end, not only did I increase my knowledge of Shakespeare, but improve my coding skills as well.</p>

              <li class="left">
                      <p>During this time around my sophomore year, I was learning about who Shakespeare was and what his work was about. Since being in Web Design, my Web Design and English teachers decided to collaborate and have us create a website that explained the life and work of Shakespeare. My website inclided many facts about subjects such as tradgedies and romanticism as well as the life of Shakespeare himself.</p>

                      <p>Getting to put together a video was pretty cool. Not just the recording, but the editing part as well. With the use of my own personal resources, I was able to piece together a video that I recorded all by myself. Recording the activities was a little awkward, but editing the video was where I had a lot of fun. Including my own credits scene was the best part. I mean, who wouldn't want to include their favorite songs and put a little comedy in a video?!</p>

                      <p>This project was especially fun to do. The purpose of this project was to choose five different activities that I do every morning before I go to school and pronounce the sentences in Spanish. So, I chose waking up in the morning, brushing my teeth, washing my face, taking a shower and getting dressed. After recording the activities, I took the individual videos and placed them in iMovie, where I edited and pieced the whole thing together.</p>

This project wasn't too big of an assignment, but more of a fun little activity. Having to recreate the fruits in Sketchbook Pro and create a background reflected what I had learned about using the program from Ms. Clark.</p>

                      <p>This was a fun little assignment where we had to recreate images in paintings using the Sketchbook Pro program. In my painting, I had recreated a dragon fruit, a mango, and an apple. The goal was to place the fruit together and add a background afterwards. I pictured my fruit to be place in a nice setting, so I put them in on a plain with a setting sun.</p>

                      <p>Doing this project was pretty fun. We learned a new design and practiced how to make them on our own. After I got my picture of Ms. Williams and placed her photo into Photoshop, I had to backtrack to the tutorials so I could apply it to this specific picture. After trial and error, I was able to successfully "Warhol" Ms. Williams up!</p>

                      <p>Here, I was in the process of learning the Andy Warhol effect, one of the most famous designs around the world. In preparation of taking tests for design, we were tasked with having to break down the components of the Andy Warhol effect and analyze them. After understanding and practicing how to do the effect, we had to go out and take a picture of another teacher in the school and have them as our Andy Warhol target. In my case, I chose my physics teacher, Ms. Williams. After following the steps, I successfully added the effect to the picture.</p>

                      <p>The sketchbook project personally a great assignment overall in my opinion. I was able to explore different ideas and focus on one that peaked my interest, which was happiness in my case. Since the topic was so broad, I was able to go in many more directions, however I could only focus on a few approaches. When I decided to go with what happiness meant to me, I began feeling warm inside while I began to remember all the fun times I had when I was filled with joy.</p>

                      <p>This sketchbook project took quite a while. Starting the project was just brainstorming ideas into topics that interested ourselves. While I was brainstorming, I decided to head in the direction of happiness. Since it was such a broad topic, I was able to explore so much more about the topic. However, the broad topic was a bit difficult since it can be taken in more than one way. To take it to my advatage, I focused on what happiness specifically meant to me. So, I looked around my old pictures an decided to use the pictures that held all of my happy memories. From there, I let my imagination loose with the creation of the poster, creating something that gave a relaxing and nostalgic mood.</p>

                      <p>To be honest, this project was aggrivating after I had placed the mountains. It was good from the start, but as I placed more items in attempt to make it look live, it was still lacking that "pop" that I was aiming for. When I tried to make it asymmetrical by placing a river between the words, yet again it still lacked that live look that I was aiming for. But on that last day it was due, I pulled the scenic features and created one whole new one, which was a waterfall. During the process of creating the waterfall, it was all coming together. In the end, the makeover satisfying.</p>

                      <p>For this project, I created a poster for the upcoming Brian Head Arts Festival. When I was given this assignment, I instantly pictured a poster that would immediately attract other people's attention. To start off, I created mountains that resembled the actual ones at Brian Head Resort. Afterwards, I tried to make the poster more live by placing a river in the middle and placing the words around it. However, it didn't have what I was looking for. After trial and error, I decided to add a waterfall while the words had its own place to show itself the anyone interested in the festival.</p>

                      <p>This client project wasn't too much of a challenge. I was able to meet the client's needs and get the job done swiftly. Since Nathan's a good friend of mine, making the website how he wanted was pretty easy. Asking him where he wanted his content and how he wanted to show his work was simple and allowed me to get it done quickly. On the other hand, making the website responsive was rather difficult. There were situations where some of the code would not do what I wanted it to do. But after messing with the code a little bit, I was able to get it on a reponsive level.</p>

                      <p>To step the game up, my Web Design teacher, Ms. Chang, decided to have me create a client website for who ever I chose. To make things fun and easier, I offered to create a website for my friend Nathan Martinez, who loves photography and takes his own pictures. Since I knew him pretty well, communication was a bliss because he was someone I talked to everyday. The process started off with collecting content that the client wanted on the website and information about him. From there, I created the wireframe, sitemap, mockup, and logo according to his needs. Creating the website itself wasn't too hard either. When I'd progress with the website, I'd code it according to how my client wanted it, which was pretty simple. I created standard links that explained who he was, showed his work, and a contact page for anyone to communicate with him.</p>

                      <p>This Movie Video Project was a big assignment that was collaborated between our U.S. History and English class. The objective was to create a music video about the topic that was assigned to my group, which was the Nuclear Arms Race. We started out with with some lyrics to get an idea of what main components of the subject we'd focus on. Afterwards, we came up with a storyboard to organize what we were to record that would represent the lyrics in the video. After receiving the a-ok from our teachers, my group and I began recording. The recording process took about 3 days to film all of the rough cuts and another day to edit all the shots into one whole video. When the project was finally due, we all watched the everyone else's videos for the next 3 days.</p>
